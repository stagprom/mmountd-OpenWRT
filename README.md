# mmountd-OpenWRT
###Minimalistic (auto) mount daemon

This repository contains support to compile and run [mmountd](https://github.com/stagprom/mmountd) on OpenWRT.
The behavior of mmountd will be controlled by an UCI configuration file and a HOTPLUG script.
Also included is a small helper script wich signals the mountstatus with a router LED.
